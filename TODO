## General ##
	- Add handeling multiple files. How will sharing work?? Module like??
	- Think of some useful __builtin functions
	- make this work "opp test.c out.c" (file out.c should share global declarations from test.c)

## Opp Parser ##
	- Add type defaults like auto, int since TYPE_NONE is default
	- FIX enum / struct / union declarations (make sure work with typedef)
	- When using typedef in decl make sure attributes are not overwritten
	- Make sure Teranary works correctly
	- Add sizeof 
	- Add postfix expr

## Opp Semantics ##
	- Begin writing analizer, possibly conbine symantic analysis with code gen
	first check if this is possible

## Opp VM ##
	- Brainstorm opcodes / structure of VM
	- How to deal with all C types especially struct/union and bit-fields
	- Handeling threads??
