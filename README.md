# Announcement
NEW UPDATE!! O++ is finally evolving into its new syntax. For now I am working on creating the O++ interpreter however I'm Deciding on whether to keep O++ as an interpreter or have a portable VM for it

# O++ Language
By: Maks Sawoniewicz

# Purpose
O++ is a small scritping language similar to Lua, which is great for small tasks and embedding in C. O++ is being worked on towards providing a friendy syntax while also providing max portability and efficiency. 

# Run / Compile
To run O++ go into the O++ folder and in Opp-Interpreter there is a 'Build.bash' file that you can run to compile O++ from source.

# Using O++ Syntax
If you want to use my own custom made o++ syntax highlighting, I made an XML file under the XML folder that you can import to notepad++ to use O++ syntax and grammar.

# Examples
Examples in example folder!

```ruby
# Comment

print 'Hello World';
```
